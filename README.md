# Raspbarry_Tensorflow_Robot
Raspberry Pi intelligent recognition robot based on Tensorflow.
## Implement function
> 1.Use the Raspberry Pi GPIO port to control the forward, backward, left, right, and right movements of the robot and the movement of the robotic arm, and control the up and down movement of the camera through the stepper motor. (With non-blocking input)

> 2.Use Tensorflow for image recognition.

> 3.Use the RPI Cam web interface to transmit video information to the web end in real time.

> 4.Select the most likely content among the recognized content for voice output.
